# Album Optimization with Relative Values

## Introduction
In this project we tried to get an optimized album of French Lebanese trumpeter Ibrahim Maalouf. There is 50 songs with their durations and popularities in total, 30 minutes total time constraint and 0.02 popularity point reduction for empty seconds in album. First part of code tries to maximize popularity points wtihin constraints. Also, there is data about in which order listeners prefer to listen songs. Second part of code tries to put order that will give us maximum order points. In both parts, algorithms were created in heuristics methods.
